### Cellcircuit Model
## Overview
The objective of this project is to simulate a cell circuit model to explain the emergence of scarring based on the work in a paper by [Adler et al.](https://www.cell.com/iscience/pdf/S2589-0042(20)30024-9.pdf) which focuses on macrophages (**M**) and myofibroblasts (**mF**) as main actors in an injured tissue.  
Both of them secrete growth factors (PDGF and CSF) supporting the proliferation of the cell type -either in an autokrine or parakrine loop or even both.
